# Xamarin.iOS Binding for a Swift Framework

Demo on how you can bind a swift framework without specific access to non-objc compatible framework apis and consume it in your Xamarin.iOS application

# Workspace has two parts

- Xcode projects with a Swift Framework, its Swift Framework Proxy and Single view application to consume both
- Xamarin projects with a Xamarin.iOS binding and Xamarin.iOS single view application to consume the binding
